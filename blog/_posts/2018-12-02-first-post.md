I believe that it is important for scientists, aspiring researchers and contractors to have an online presence. This site is designed to highlight the things I find most interesting in a wide variety of fields. As I add additional information about my projects and interests, additional categories will be added to the sidebar.

To learn more about my professional accomplishments and skills, please feel free to browse the site. You will find a summary of my background, skills, and my current interests. Links to my publications are found at on the *Publications and Writing Samples* page of this site.

I am currently looking for contracts as an exploration or mine geologist in Western Australia and elsewhere. Please consider reaching out if you'd like to involve me in your projects. My contact information is on the *Contact Details* page.
